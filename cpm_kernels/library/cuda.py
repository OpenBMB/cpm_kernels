CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT = 201
#   This most frequently indicates that there is no context bound to the current thread. This can also be returned if the context passed to an API call is not a valid handle (such as a context that has had cuCtxDestroy() invoked on it). This can also be returned if a user mixes different API versions (i.e. 3010 context with 3020 API calls). See cuCtxGetApiVersion() for more details.

CUDA_ERROR_NOT_READY = 600
#   This indicates that asynchronous operations issued previously have not completed yet. This result is not actually an error, but must be indicated differently than CUDA_SUCCESS (which indicates completion). Calls that may return this value include cuEventQuery() and cuStreamQuery(). 
CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS = 700
#   While executing a kernel, the device encountered a load or store instruction on an invalid memory address. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched. 
CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_OUT_OF_RESOURCES = 701
#   This indicates that a launch did not occur because it did not have appropriate resources. This error usually indicates that the user has attempted to pass too many arguments to the device kernel, or the kernel launch specifies too many threads for the kernel's register count. Passing arguments of the wrong size (i.e. a 64-bit pointer when a 32-bit int is expected) is equivalent to passing too many arguments and can also result in this error. 
CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT = 702
#   This indicates that the device kernel took too long to execute. This can only occur if timeouts are enabled - see the device attribute CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_KERNEL_EXEC_TIMEOUT for more information.

CUDA_ERROR_TOO_MANY_PEERS = 711
#   This error indicates that the hardware resources required to enable peer access have been exhausted for one or more of the devices passed to cuCtxEnablePeerAccess(). 
CUDA_ERROR_HOST_MEMORY_ALREADY_REGISTERED = 712
#   This error indicates that the memory range passed to cuMemHostRegister() has already been registered. 
CUDA_ERROR_HOST_MEMORY_NOT_REGISTERED = 713
#   This error indicates that the pointer passed to cuMemHostUnregister() does not correspond to any currently registered memory region. 
CUDA_ERROR_HARDWARE_STACK_ERROR = 714
#   While executing a kernel, the device encountered a stack error. This can be due to stack corruption or exceeding the stack size limit. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched. 
CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION = 715
#   While executing a kernel, the device encountered an illegal instruction. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched. 
CUDA_ERROR_MISALIGNED_ADDRESS = 716
#   While executing a kernel, the device encountered a load or store instruction on a memory address which is not aligned. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched. 
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS_SPACE = 717
#   While executing a kernel, the device encountered an instruction which can only operate on memory locations in certain address spaces (global, shared, or local), but was supplied a memory address not belonging to an allowed address space. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched. 
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_PC = 718
#   While executing a kernel, the device program counter wrapped its address space. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched. 
CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_FAILED = 719
#   An exception occurred on the device while executing a kernel. Common causes include dereferencing an invalid device pointer and accessing out of bounds shared memory. Less common cases can be system specific - more information about these cases can be found in the system specific user guide. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched.

CUDA_ERROR_SYSTEM_NOT_READY = 802
#   This error indicates that the system is not yet ready to start any CUDA work. To continue using CUDA, verify the system configuration is in a valid state and all required driver daemons are actively running. More information about this error can be found in the system specific user guide. 
CUDA_ERROR_SYSTEM_DRIVER_MISMATCH = 803
#   This error indicates that there is a mismatch between the versions of the display driver and the CUDA driver. Refer to the compatibility documentation for supported versions. 
CUDA_ERROR_COMPAT_NOT_SUPPORTED_ON_DEVICE = 804
#   This error indicates that the system was upgraded to run with forward compatibility but the visible hardware detected by CUDA does not support this configuration. Refer to the compatibility documentation for the supported hardware matrix or ensure that only supported hardware is visible during initialization via the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable.

#   This error indicates that the remote procedural call between the MPS server and the MPS client failed. 
CUDA_ERROR_MPS_SERVER_NOT_READY = 807

CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_MERGE = 902
#   This error indicates that the operation would have resulted in a merge of two independent capture sequences. 
CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_UNMATCHED = 903
#   This error indicates that the capture was not initiated in this stream. 
CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_UNJOINED = 904
#   This error indicates that the capture sequence contains a fork that was not joined to the primary stream. 
CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_ISOLATION = 905
#   This error indicates that a dependency would have been created which crosses the capture sequence boundary. Only implicit in-stream ordering dependencies are allowed to cross the boundary. 
CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_IMPLICIT = 906
#   This error indicates a disallowed implicit dependency on a current capture sequence from cudaStreamLegacy. 
CUDA_ERROR_CAPTURED_EVENT = 907

CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_WRONG_THREAD = 908
#   A stream capture sequence not initiated with the CU_STREAM_CAPTURE_MODE_RELAXED argument to cuStreamBeginCapture was passed to cuStreamEndCapture in a different thread.

#   This indicates that an async error has occurred in a device outside of CUDA. If CUDA was waiting for an external device's signal before consuming shared data, the external device signaled an error indicating that the data is not valid for consumption. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched.
