cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration = 9
#   This indicates that a kernel launch is requesting resources that can never be satisfied by the current device. Requesting more shared memory per block than the device supports will trigger this error, as will requesting too many threads or blocks. See cudaDeviceProp for more device limitations.

cudaErrorTextureFetchFailed = 23
#   Deprecated
#   This error return is deprecated as of CUDA 3.1. Device emulation mode was removed with the CUDA 3.1 release.

#   This indicated that an emulated device pointer exceeded the 32-bit address range.
cudaErrorStubLibrary = 34
#   This indicates that the CUDA driver that the application has loaded is a stub library. Applications that run with the stub rather than a real driver loaded will result in CUDA API returning this error. 
cudaErrorInsufficientDriver = 35
#   This indicates that the installed NVIDIA CUDA driver is older than the CUDA runtime library. This is not a supported configuration. Users should install an updated NVIDIA display driver to allow the application to run. 
cudaErrorCallRequiresNewerDriver = 36

#   This indicates that multiple surfaces (across separate CUDA source files in the application) share the same string name. 
cudaErrorDevicesUnavailable = 46
#   This indicates that all CUDA devices are busy or unavailable at the current time. Devices are often busy/unavailable due to use of cudaComputeModeExclusive, cudaComputeModeProhibited or when long running CUDA kernels have filled up the GPU and are blocking new work from starting. They can also be unavailable due to memory constraints on a device that already has active CUDA work being performed. 
cudaErrorIncompatibleDriverContext = 49
#   This indicates that the current context is not compatible with this the CUDA Runtime. This can only occur if you are using CUDA Runtime/Driver interoperability and have created an existing Driver context using the driver API. The Driver context may be incompatible either because the Driver context was created using an older version of the API, because the Runtime API call expects a primary driver context and the Driver context is not primary, or because the Driver context has been destroyed. Please see Interactions with the CUDA Driver API" for more information. 
cudaErrorMissingConfiguration = 52
#   The device function being invoked (usually via cudaLaunchKernel()) was not previously configured via the cudaConfigureCall() function. 
cudaErrorPriorLaunchFailure = 53

cudaErrorSyncDepthExceeded = 68
#   This error indicates that a call to cudaDeviceSynchronize made from the device runtime failed because the call was made at grid depth greater than than either the default (2 levels of grids) or user specified device limit cudaLimitDevRuntimeSyncDepth. To be able to synchronize on launched grids at a greater depth successfully, the maximum nested depth at which cudaDeviceSynchronize will be called must be specified with the cudaLimitDevRuntimeSyncDepth limit to the cudaDeviceSetLimit api before the host-side launch of a kernel using the device runtime. Keep in mind that additional levels of sync depth require the runtime to reserve large amounts of device memory that cannot be used for user allocations. 
cudaErrorLaunchPendingCountExceeded = 69
#   This error indicates that a device runtime grid launch failed because the launch would exceed the limit cudaLimitDevRuntimePendingLaunchCount. For this launch to proceed successfully, cudaDeviceSetLimit must be called to set the cudaLimitDevRuntimePendingLaunchCount to be higher than the upper bound of outstanding launches that can be issued to the device runtime. Keep in mind that raising the limit of pending device runtime launches will require the runtime to reserve device memory that cannot be used for user allocations.

#   This indicates an internal startup failure in the CUDA runtime. 
cudaErrorInvalidKernelImage = 200
#   This indicates that the device kernel image is invalid. 
cudaErrorDeviceUninitialized = 201
#   This most frequently indicates that there is no context bound to the current thread. This can also be returned if the context passed to an API call is not a valid handle (such as a context that has had cuCtxDestroy() invoked on it). This can also be returned if a user mixes different API versions (i.e. 3010 context with 3020 API calls). See cuCtxGetApiVersion() for more details.

cudaErrorOperatingSystem = 304
#   This error indicates that an OS call failed. 
cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle = 400
#   This indicates that a resource handle passed to the API call was not valid. Resource handles are opaque types like cudaStream_t and cudaEvent_t. 
cudaErrorIllegalState = 401
#   This indicates that a resource required by the API call is not in a valid state to perform the requested operation.

cudaErrorLaunchOutOfResources = 701
#   This indicates that a launch did not occur because it did not have appropriate resources. Although this error is similar to cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration, this error usually indicates that the user has attempted to pass too many arguments to the device kernel, or the kernel launch specifies too many threads for the kernel's register count. 
cudaErrorLaunchTimeout = 702
#   This indicates that the device kernel took too long to execute. This can only occur if timeouts are enabled - see the device property kernelExecTimeoutEnabled for more information. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched. 
cudaErrorLaunchIncompatibleTexturing = 703
#   This error indicates a kernel launch that uses an incompatible texturing mode.

#   This error indicates that a call to cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess() is trying to re-enable peer addressing on from a context which has already had peer addressing enabled. 
cudaErrorPeerAccessNotEnabled = 705
#   This error indicates that cudaDeviceDisablePeerAccess() is trying to disable peer addressing which has not been enabled yet via cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess(). 
cudaErrorSetOnActiveProcess = 708
#   This indicates that the user has called cudaSetValidDevices(), cudaSetDeviceFlags(), cudaD3D9SetDirect3DDevice(), cudaD3D10SetDirect3DDevice, cudaD3D11SetDirect3DDevice(), or cudaVDPAUSetVDPAUDevice() after initializing the CUDA runtime by calling non-device management operations (allocating memory and launching kernels are examples of non-device management operations). This error can also be returned if using runtime/driver interoperability and there is an existing CUcontext active on the host thread.

#   This error indicates that the pointer passed to cudaHostUnregister() does not correspond to any currently registered memory region. 
cudaErrorHardwareStackError = 714
#   Device encountered an error in the call stack during kernel execution, possibly due to stack corruption or exceeding the stack size limit. This leaves the process in an inconsistent state and any further CUDA work will return the same error. To continue using CUDA, the process must be terminated and relaunched. 
cudaErrorIllegalInstruction = 715
